  <p>I worked as a part-time lecturer and a cooperative professor in many universities and colleges in South Korea
    between 2013-2019. During this period, I taught compositions, arranging, advanced harmonies, and music analysis
    courses among many others. I guess my status was similar to that of "adjunct" professor's in U.S now. Not on tenure
    track, but teaching almost 40hours a week on semeter-by-semester contract. One thing I can say for certain about
    this experience is that it was never of my plans when I started out as a musician.</p>
