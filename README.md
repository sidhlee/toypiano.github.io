# Hello World

Hi, welcome to my github page. My name is Hayoun Lee, and I am a full-stack web developer.  
This page is is mainly for the employers and recruiters to help their process to evaluate their potential cadidate (that'll be meüñê) for job opening.
Like many other developers today, I come from different background other than computer science. Before becoming a full-stack developer, I was a award-winning jazz pianist, composer, song-writer, and university professor. (not in particular order). My band had the album that topped K-Indie chart in South Korea and had won multiple awards including 'Best Rock Album of the Year'.
